## üöÄ Getting Started

### 2. Install Dependencies

- **Arduino IDE**  
- **Firebase Arduino library**  
- **ESP8266/ESP32 board support**

### 3. Configure Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
2. Create a new project.  
3. Add a web app and enable **Realtime Database**.  
4. Copy your `FIREBASE_HOST` and `FIREBASE_AUTH` credentials.  

### 4. Upload Code to Microcontroller

- Open the main `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.  
- Replace Wi-Fi and Firebase credentials.  
- Upload to your board.  

### 5. Monitor Data

- Open **Serial Monitor** to check sensor readings.  
- Use **Firebase Console** to visualize real-time data.
